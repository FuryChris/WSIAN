# Tech Reminders

## Project made by myself for myself

I wanted to group here some comments and examples about things i learned some time ago, that I can just get'in and make quick refresh.

Most content is taken from other sources (YT courses, udemy courses, papers, etc.) - then enhanced for my needs and commented.

I doubt that this will be helpfull for you, dear reader, however if you like it, feel free to use and have fun :).
